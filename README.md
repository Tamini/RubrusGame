RubrusGame
==========

A multi-player game created using the Java programming language.  Players attempt to fit as many of their pieces as they 
can on the board.  Players can play in teams of 2 (in order to play 2 vs 2) or free-for-all.  



Rubrus was created in Grade 11 using Java.

Rubrus was a group collaboration between Victor Cong, Chen Chou and myself.  
Victor designed and created most of the graphics, including the pieces themselves and the main menu screen. 
Chen created the content for the various menus in the game.  
I wrote almost all of the coding for Rubrus, including the movement of pieces and their intereactions with each other.
